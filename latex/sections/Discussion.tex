Task 3
The purpose of this task and the previous problem was to demonstrate that with ξ=1, the system reaches equilibrium, and the average kinetic energy (and hence the temperature) of the two gases is the same. However, when ξ<1, the system does not reach equilibrium, and the two gases do not have the same temperature. The comment about the TC model in the Appendix was also taken into consideration.
