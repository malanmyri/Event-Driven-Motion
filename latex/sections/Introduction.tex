\section{Introduction}

The aim of this report is to simulate the collision of particles in a box with the help of an event-driven simulation method. 
The simulation involves four problems, which are investigated separately. 

In Problem 1, we investigate the speed distribution of a gas of 
hard disks, and the results are compared with the theoretically 
expected 2D Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. 


In Problem 2, we simulate a mixture of two gases with different 
masses per particle, and we compare the speed distribution and 
the average kinetic energy of each gas. In Problem 3, we investigate 
the behavior of the system with different values of the elastiticity 
coefficient, eta, and study the development of the average kinetic energy 
and temperature of each gas as a function of time. Finally, in Problem 4, 
we study the formation of a crater following a projectile impact 
on a wall of particles, and we investigate the effect of input 
parameters on the size of the crater. The simulation involves a 
large number of particles, and the simulations are carried out 
until the system reaches equilibrium or until the initial energy 
of the system is dissipated. The details of each problem and the 
results obtained are discussed in the following sections.
